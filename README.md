# Horiseon-refactor

This project was given with motivation to refactor a website that aides accessibility. The goal was to contribute to a more inclusive web environment by ensuring usability for individuals with diverse needs. The project addresses the common issue of exclusionary web design by adhering to accessibility standards. In the development process we emphasized the importance of writing "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, promoting efficiency and maintainability.Through this process, valuable insights were gained into the technical and impactful aspects of web accessibility, emphasizing its fundamental role in user-centric development.
